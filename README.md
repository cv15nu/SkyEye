# SkyEye
Dataset for analyzing lane-less traffic behavior at intersections

The SkyEye dataset is the first aerial dataset for monitoring intersections with mixed traffic and lane-less behavior. Around 1 hour of video each from 4 intersections, namely, Paldi (P), Nehru bridge - Ashram road (N), Swami Vivekananda bridge - Ashram road (V), and APMC market (A) in the city of Ahmedabad, India.

These intersections were considered because of the diverse
traffic conditions they present. While Paldi and Nehru bridge
are four-way signalized intersections, the intersection at Swami
Vivekananda bridge is a seven-way signalized intersection,
and APMC market is a three-way non-signalized intersection.
Hence, this dataset comprehensively covers a wide variety
of traffic conditions for both signalized and non-signalized
intersections. The videos were captured using the included
camera in the DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone at 50 frames per
second in 4K resolution (4096x2160). The annotated dataset
contains 50,000 frames in total from all the intersections. In
these 50,000 frames, a total of 4,021 distinct vehicle tracks
are annotated that include 421 cars, 77 buses, 2,185 twowheelers,
and 973 auto-rickshaws.
